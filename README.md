# Linux Command Generator (CSV Version)
This tool is a PHP-based Linux command generator designed to help users quickly find and construct Linux commands based on pre-configured options. It is particularly useful for those learning Linux commands or anyone needing quick references without switching between documentation.


## Features
Static Command Database: Built on a CSV file that defines available commands and options, providing a predefined set of commands.
User-Friendly Search: Users can search for commands and options through a streamlined interface, with results rendered based on the CSV configuration.
Cross-Distro Compatibility: The commands and syntax provided are compatible with popular distributions like Ubuntu, CentOS, and macOS.
Offline Availability: No internet required—works offline once the CSV file and tool are downloaded.

## Installation
Download the repository files.
Set Up: Place the tool on any web server capable of running PHP (e.g., Apache, Nginx).

## Configuration:
Ensure the commands.csv file is in the same directory as the PHP script.
No database setup is required, as the tool reads directly from the CSV file.

## Usage
Search: Enter the command you’re looking for in the search box. The tool will display matching commands and options from the CSV file.
View Command Structure: For each command, you’ll see options and syntax based on the CSV’s pre-defined configurations.

## Contributing
Contributions to the CSV file for additional commands and options are welcome! This tool is open for community support to make Linux command-line usage easier for all.
